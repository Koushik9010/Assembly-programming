Assembly language is a low-level programming language that 
is a symbolic representation of machine code instructions. 
It is specific to a particular computer architecture and provides 
a more human-readable format for programming compared to raw machine code. 
Programmers use assembly language to write programs that directly control a computer's hardware.

Multiplication in Assembly Language:
Multiplication in assembly involves using specific instructions to perform the operation. 
For example, in x86 architecture, the "MUL" instruction is often employed.
The operands are usually loaded into registers, and the result is stored back in registers. 
Assembly language provides direct control over the hardware, allowing programmers to optimize
multiplication routines for specific applications, enhancing performance in critical scenarios.
